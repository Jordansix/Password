# Password
Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected.

Wrote down temp password so we can stat writing our code within the function.

Wrote down console log to see if my clickes are being implemented. 

Made the prompts so the user can be presented to them.

Went into the function of write password and only if they give me the right prompts will it either generate a random password or not.

Created the for loop for choosing the random letter or choosing random numbers or letters within my index.

For loop is done now whatever it ends up with it will return it to the user.

realized I had 2 of the ame password words so I changed it to setpassword and the other is left the same as password.
